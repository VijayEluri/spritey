Thanks to everyone who was directly or indirectly involved in this project to
make it possible, including:

* Peter Severin for giving us a free open-source developer license for his
  wireframe and mockup tool called WireframeSketcher.
  (http://wireframesketcher.com/about.html)
  
* Github for making such a great social network for programmers and providing
  free hosting services to open-source projects. (https://github.com/)

* The developers of Eclipse for creating such a great platform. Without it there
  would be no Spritey! ;)
