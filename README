Spritey is an open-source sprite sheet creator, written in Java on top of
Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP). The application is devided into two modules,
the core logic and the RCP. The core has been moved out of the RCP project to
allow extensions such as various importers to be written independantly of the
RCP and licensed under different licenses if necessary.

This tool is distributed under GNU GPL version 3, which can be found in the file
COPYING.

Each project comes with project specific settings enabled for consistency and
coding style reasons. Which means some of your global settings in Eclipse will
not be applied to this project. Do not disable or modify those settings if you
wish to contribute to this project. We need to follow some rules to make
everybody happy! ;)

Also, check out the CREDITS file to see the acknowledgements to people who
kindly contributed to this project.

Enjoy!
Spritey Team.
