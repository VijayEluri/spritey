<p>After a long discussion with a friend of mine and a new contributor to this project, <a href="http://alanmorey.com" target="_blank">Alan Morey</a>, I've decided to rename this project to "<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spritey" target="_blank">Spritey</a>" - suggested by Alan. According to <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com" target="_blank">Urban Dictionary</a> "<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spritey" target="_blank">Spritey</a>" means very energetic. So, hopefully this project will be as energetic as its name suggests. ;)</p>
