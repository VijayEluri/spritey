After a long discussion with a friend of mine and a new contributor to this project, [Alan Morey][alan_morey], I've decided to rename this project to Spritey - suggested by Alan. According to [Urban Dictionary][urban_dic] [spritey][spritey] means very energetic. So, hopefully this project will be as energetic as its name suggests. ;)
