I've put together a quick UI prototype using <a href="http://wireframesketcher.com">WireframeSketcher</a> developed by <a href="http://wireframesketcher.com/about.html">Peter Severin</a>. WireframeSketcher is an Eclipse plugin for creating screen mockups. It has a rich library of UI components which lets you create prototypes really fast. It is also very easy to create custom widgets by combining various components together. What I also like about this tool is its clean interface and the fact that it's part of Eclipse which means no switching between applications and mockups are saved within a project. It might not be a big deal but for me it's very important to have everything in one place. ;) I would like to thank Peter for kindly giving me a free open-source developer license and I would like to encourage anyone looking for such tool to check it out. This tool is amazing.

So, there going to be two sprite sheet views:

<ul>
<li>Canvas (positioned on the left) - will render spites how they will actually appear in the exported sheet.</li>
<li>Sprite List/Tree (positioned top-right) - will group sprites by their classes.</li>
</ul>
There will also be three sprite views:

<ul>
<li>Graphical - will be rendered to the canvas.</li>
<li>Sprite List Item - will only render sprite class value/text in the Sprite List.</li>
<li>Sprite Properties (positioned bottom-right) - will display sprite attributes that can be changed manually.</li>
</ul>
