Today was a house keeping day for me. My site was broken after Google updated their jQuery library so I had to do a little bit of fixing, which eventually brought me to this blog.

I feel like I should explain why there hasn't been any updates on this project's progress. Well, I simply haven't been working on it since November! I'm currently working on a web project and once it's finished I will continue working on this tool.
