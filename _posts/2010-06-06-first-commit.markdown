Yesterday I imported the Spritey eclipse project into [github repository][github]. The project has project-specific configurations enabled to make code more consistent and merging a lot easier.

The next step is to set up [Groovy][groovy]. Groovy, for its dynamic nature, is going to be used for testing.
